# Release Automation - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The `wizarr-release` workflow (actually named `release.yml`) was not being triggered because:

1. **Duplicate workflows** were conflicting - both `auto-release.yml` and `create-release.yml` were trying to create releases from the same Release PRs
2. **Potential draft releases** - releases might have been created as drafts instead of published releases

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed Workflow Conflicts**
- **Disabled `auto-release.yml`** - This workflow was redundant with `create-release.yml`
- **Enhanced `create-release.yml`** - Made it the canonical release creator with better validation

### ✅ **Ensured Published Releases**
- Added `--latest` flag to `gh release create` command
- Added verification step to confirm release is published (not draft)
- Added error handling to fail if release is accidentally created as draft

### ✅ **Enhanced Release Content**
- **Improved conventional commit detection** - Now properly detects ALL conventional commit types:
  - 💥 Breaking Changes (`BREAKING CHANGE` or `!`)
  - 🚀 Features (`feat:`)
  - 🐛 Bug Fixes (`fix:`)
  - ⚡ Performance (`perf:`)
  - ♻️ Refactoring (`refactor:`)
  - 📚 Documentation (`docs:`)
  - 🧪 Tests (`test:`)
  - 🔧 Build/Dependencies (`build:`, `deps:`)
  - 🏗️ CI/CD (`ci:`)
  - 💄 Styling (`style:`)
  - 🧹 Chores (`chore:`)
  - 📝 Other Changes (non-conventional)

- **Enhanced PR descriptions** - Release PRs now include:
  - Categorized changelog with emojis
  - Complete commit list in collapsible section
  - Full commit hashes for traceability

### ✅ **Fixed Regex Patterns**
- Updated all commit hash patterns from `[a-f0-9]+` to `[a-fA-F0-9]+` to handle uppercase hex digits
- Fixed conventional commit detection in both CalVer automation and auto-release workflows

## Current Release Flow

```
1. Main Branch Push
         ↓
2. CalVer Automation Creates/Updates Release PR
   (.github/workflows/calver-automation.yml)
         ↓
3. Release PR Merged (title: "Release v*")
         ↓
4. create-release.yml Creates Published GitHub Release
   (.github/workflows/create-release.yml)
         ↓
5. release.yml (wizarr-release) Builds & Pushes Docker Images
   (.github/workflows/release.yml)
```

## Key Improvements

### **Before:**
- Conflicting workflows creating duplicate releases
- Only detected `feat:` and `fix:` commits
- Releases might be created as drafts
- Basic PR descriptions

### **After:**
- Clean, single workflow chain
- Comprehensive conventional commit detection
- Guaranteed published releases with validation
- Detailed, categorized changelog and commit tracking
- Proper wizarr-release workflow triggering

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/auto-release.yml`** - Disabled to avoid conflicts
2. **`.github/workflows/create-release.yml`** - Enhanced with --latest flag and validation
3. **`.github/actions/calver-automation/action.sh`** - Improved commit detection and PR content
4. **`scripts/test_release_automation.sh`** - Test script for commit categorization
5. **`scripts/test_release_flow.sh`** - Test script for workflow chain verification

## Testing

Both test scripts confirm:
- ✅ All conventional commit types properly detected and categorized
- ✅ Workflow chain properly configured and non-conflicting
- ✅ Published releases guaranteed with --latest flag
- ✅ wizarr-release workflow will be triggered by published releases

The release automation should now work end-to-end: commits → Release PR → GitHub Release → Docker build!
