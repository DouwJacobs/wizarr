# Customise The Wizard

Give your new users a personalized onboarding experience with Wizarr's powerful wizard system. Create custom welcome flows that guide users through setting up their media apps, understanding your server, and more.

***

## Overview

Wizarr's wizard system supports multiple approaches for creating and managing onboarding steps:

1. **Database-backed steps** (recommended) - Create and manage steps through the admin interface
2. **Pre-invite and post-invite categories** - Show steps before or after users accept invitations ([Learn more](pre-post-invite-steps.md))
3. **Wizard bundles** - Custom sequences of steps for specific invitation types
4. **Multi-server wizards** - Automatic flows for invitations covering multiple servers
5. **Legacy file-based steps** - Markdown files as fallback (still supported)

***

## 1 Â· Managing Wizard Steps Through the Admin Interface

### Accessing the Wizard Admin

Navigate to **Settings** â†’ **Wizard** in your Wizarr admin panel to manage wizard steps and bundles.

### Creating Default Steps

Default steps are server-type specific and will be shown to all users invited to that server type.

1. **Click "Default Steps"** in the wizard settings
2. **Click "Create Step"** to add a new step
3. **Select the server type**: `plex`, `jellyfin`, `emby`, `audiobookshelf`, `romm`, or `komga`
4. **Write your content** using Markdown
5. **Set conditional display** (optional) using the `requires` field

### Step Fields

- **Server Type**: Which media server this step applies to
- **Category**: When to show this step - "Before Invite Acceptance" (pre-invite) or "After Invite Acceptance" (post-invite)
- **Title**: Optional override for the step heading
- **Markdown**: The main content of your step
- **Requires**: Comma-separated setting keys that must be truthy for the step to display
- **Require Interaction**: When enabled, users must click a link or button in the step before they can proceed to the next step

> **New Feature**: The **Category** field allows you to control whether steps are shown before or after users accept invitations. [Learn more about pre-invite and post-invite steps](pre-post-invite-steps.md).

### Conditional Step Display

Use the `requires` field to show steps only when certain conditions are met:

```
discord_url,enable_notifications
```

This step will only show if both `discord_url` and `enable_notifications` settings have truthy values.

***

## 2 Â· Wizard Bundles (Custom Flows)

Wizard bundles allow you to create completely custom onboarding sequences that can be assigned to specific invitations.

### Creating a Bundle

1. **Click "Custom Bundles"** in the wizard settings
2. **Click "Create Bundle"** 
3. **Name your bundle** (e.g., "VIP Onboarding", "Family Setup")
4. **Add a description** (optional)
5. **Create and assign steps** to your bundle

### Bundle Steps

Bundle steps are different from default steps:
- **No server type** - they're not tied to a specific media server
- **Flexible ordering** - drag and drop to reorder steps within the bundle
- **Custom content** - can include any markdown content you want
- **Interaction requirements** - can also be configured to require user interaction

### Assigning Bundles to Invitations

When creating an invitation, you can:
1. **Select a wizard bundle** from the dropdown
2. **Leave it as "Automatic"** to use the default server-type steps

***

## 3 Â· Multi-Server Wizard Flows

For invitations that cover multiple media servers, Wizarr automatically creates a combined wizard flow.

### How It Works

1. **User accepts invitation** for multiple servers
2. **Wizard automatically combines** steps from each server type
3. **Steps are shown in order** based on server type (alphabetical)
4. **User progresses through** all relevant steps

### Server Types Supported

- **Plex** - Media streaming server
- **Jellyfin** - Open-source media server
- **Emby** - Media server platform
- **Audiobookshelf** - Audiobook and podcast server
- **Romm** - ROM and game library manager
- **Komga** - Comic and manga library server

## 4 Â· Writing Effective Wizard Steps

### Markdown Syntax

Wizarr supports standard Markdown with some enhancements:

```markdown
# Step Title

Welcome to our **media server**! Here's what you need to know:

## Getting Started

1. Download the app using the button below
2. Sign in with your username and password
3. Start enjoying your content!

[Download App](https://example.com/download){:target="_blank" .btn}
```

### Styling Options

- **Links as buttons**: Add `{.btn}` to make links look like buttons
- **External links**: Add `{:target="_blank"}` to open in new tab
- **Images**: Use standard Markdown syntax with optional classes
- **Tailwind classes**: Add `{.class-name}` for custom styling

### Requiring User Interaction

You can force users to engage with step content before allowing them to proceed to the next step. This is useful for ensuring users actually download apps, read important information, or acknowledge terms.

#### How It Works

1. **Enable "Require Interaction"** when creating or editing a step in the admin interface
2. **Add interactive elements** like links or buttons to your step content
3. **Users must click** on at least one link or button before the "Next" button becomes enabled

#### Example Step Content

```markdown
# Download the Plex App

Before you can access our media library, you'll need to download the Plex app for your device.

**Choose your platform:**

[ðŸ“± Download for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/plex/id383457673){:target="_blank" .btn}
[ðŸ¤– Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android){:target="_blank" .btn}
[ðŸ’» Download for Windows](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=windows#plex-app){:target="_blank" .btn}

Click one of the download buttons above to continue.
```

#### Visual Feedback

- **Disabled Next Button**: Appears dimmed with reduced opacity until interaction occurs
- **Visual Indicators**: The button shows "not-allowed" cursor when hovered
- **Automatic Enable**: As soon as the user clicks any link or button, the Next button becomes active

***

## 5 Â· Legacy File-Based Steps (Fallback)

While the database-backed approach is recommended, Wizarr still supports file-based steps as a fallback.

### File Structure

```
wizard_steps/
â”œâ”€â”€ plex/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_download.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 02_setup.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 99_tips.md
â”œâ”€â”€ jellyfin/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_download.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02_about.md
â”œâ”€â”€ emby/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 01_download.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 02_about.md
â”œâ”€â”€ audiobookshelf/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 01_intro.md
â”œâ”€â”€ romm/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 01_intro.md
â””â”€â”€ komga/
    â”œâ”€â”€ 01_intro.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ 02_access.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ 03_features.md
    â””â”€â”€ 04_tips.md
```

### File-Based Front Matter

```yaml
---
title: Download the App
require: true
---

# Your content here
```

### When Files Are Used

- **No database steps exist** for the server type
- **Database is unavailable** (during migrations, etc.)
- **Fallback behavior** ensures the wizard always works

***

## 6 Â· Access Control

### Wizard Access Control

By default, wizard access is restricted to:
- **Authenticated users** (logged-in admins)
- **Users with valid invitation codes** (stored in session)

### Disabling Access Control

Set the `wizard_acl_enabled` setting to `false` to allow unrestricted access to the wizard.

***

## 7 Â· Previewing and Testing

### Preview Options

1. **Click "Preview"** button when editing steps
2. **Visit `/wizard`** while logged in to test the full flow
3. **Use invitation links** to test the user experience

### Testing Multi-Server Flows

1. **Create an invitation** for multiple servers
2. **Use the invitation link** to test the combined flow
3. **Verify step order** and content display

***

## 8 Â· Advanced Features

### Step Ordering

- **Database steps**: Automatically ordered by position
- **File-based steps**: Ordered alphabetically (use `01_`, `02_` prefixes)
- **Bundle steps**: Drag and drop to reorder

### Dynamic Content

Steps can reference server settings and configuration:

```markdown
Welcome to **{{ server_name }}**!

Your server is available at: {{ server_url }}
```

### Conditional Logic

Use the `requires` field to show steps conditionally:

```markdown
# Discord Integration

Join our Discord community for support and updates!

[Join Discord]({{ discord_url }}){:target="_blank" .btn}
```

Only shows if `discord_url` is set in the `requires` field.

***

## 9 Â· Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

- **Keep steps concise** - users want to get started quickly
- **Use clear calls-to-action** - make buttons and links obvious
- **Test on mobile** - many users will access on phones
- **Include screenshots** - visual aids help understanding
- **Use interaction requirements wisely** - only require interaction for critical steps like app downloads or terms acceptance

### Step Organization

- **Start with essentials** - app download, account setup
- **End with optional content** - advanced features, tips
- **Use logical progression** - each step builds on the previous
- **Consider user journey** - think about what they need when

### Bundle Strategy

- **Create specific bundles** for different user types
- **VIP users** might get extended onboarding
- **Family members** might need simpler instructions
- **Power users** might want advanced configuration steps

***

## 10 Â· Migration from File-Based Steps

If you're upgrading from an older version with file-based steps:

1. **Database steps take precedence** - they'll be used if they exist
2. **File-based steps remain** as fallback
3. **Import existing files** through the admin interface
4. **Gradually migrate** to database-backed approach
5. **Test thoroughly** before removing file-based steps

***

## 11 Â· Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Steps not showing | Check server type matches invitation |
| Wrong step order | Verify position values in database |
| Missing steps | Check `requires` field conditions |
| Bundle not working | Verify bundle assignment on invitation |
| Next button won't enable | Ensure step has interactive elements (links/buttons) and interaction requirement is properly configured |

### Debug Tips

1. **Check admin logs** for wizard-related errors
2. **Verify database connectivity** for step loading
3. **Test with different server types** to isolate issues
4. **Use browser dev tools** to inspect step loading
