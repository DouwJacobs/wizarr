# Pre-Invite and Post-Invite Wizard Steps

Wizarr now supports two distinct categories of wizard steps: **Before Invite Acceptance** (pre-invite) and **After Invite Acceptance** (post-invite). This powerful feature allows you to guide users through important information before they even create their account, and then continue their onboarding after they've joined.

***

## Overview

### What Are Pre-Invite Steps?

Pre-invite steps are shown to users **before** they accept an invitation and create their account. These steps are perfect for:

- **Terms of service** or community guidelines
- **Server rules** and expectations
- **Important announcements** or notices
- **Prerequisites** users should know before joining
- **App download instructions** to prepare users

### What Are Post-Invite Steps?

Post-invite steps are shown to users **after** they've accepted the invitation and created their account. These steps are ideal for:

- **Welcome messages** and getting started guides
- **App setup instructions** specific to their account
- **Feature tours** and advanced tips
- **Request system integration** (Overseerr, Ombi)
- **Discord invites** and community links

***

## How It Works

### The Invitation Flow

```
User clicks invite link
    ‚Üì
Pre-Invite Steps (if configured)
    ‚Üì
Join Page (accept invitation)
    ‚Üì
Account Creation
    ‚Üì
Post-Invite Steps (if configured)
    ‚Üì
Completion
```

### Automatic Routing

Wizarr automatically handles the flow:

1. **User clicks invitation link** ‚Üí Invite code is stored in session
2. **Pre-invite steps exist?** ‚Üí User is redirected to `/pre-wizard`
3. **No pre-invite steps?** ‚Üí User goes directly to join page
4. **After accepting invitation** ‚Üí User is redirected to `/post-wizard` (if steps exist)
5. **No post-invite steps?** ‚Üí User goes directly to completion page

### Bypass Prevention

Users **cannot skip** pre-invite steps if they're configured. The system enforces completion through server-side validation, ensuring all users see important information before joining.

## Creating Pre-Invite and Post-Invite Steps

### Accessing the Wizard Admin

Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Wizard** in your Wizarr admin panel.

### Side-by-Side Layout

The wizard admin now displays steps in a **two-column layout**:

- **Left column**: Before Invite Acceptance (pre-invite steps)
- **Right column**: After Invite Acceptance (post-invite steps)

Steps are grouped by server type (Plex, Jellyfin, Emby, etc.) within each column.

### Creating a New Step

1. **Click "Create Step"** in the wizard settings
2. **Select the server type**: `plex`, `jellyfin`, `emby`, etc.
3. **Choose the category**:
   - **Before Invite Acceptance** - Shown before user accepts invitation
   - **After Invite Acceptance** - Shown after user creates account
4. **Write your content** using Markdown
5. **Set interaction requirements** (optional)
6. **Save the step**

### Editing Existing Steps

1. **Click the edit icon** on any step
2. **Change the category** if needed (dropdown field)
3. **Update content** as desired
4. **Save changes**

***

## Drag-and-Drop Management

### Reordering Steps

You can reorder steps within the same category by **dragging and dropping**:

1. **Click and hold** the drag handle (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) on any step
2. **Drag** the step to its new position
3. **Release** to drop it in place
4. Changes are **saved automatically**

### Moving Between Categories

You can also **move steps between categories** using drag-and-drop:

1. **Drag a step** from one column to the other
2. **Drop it** in the target category
3. The step's category is **updated automatically**

### Restrictions

- Steps can only be moved **within the same server type**
- You cannot drag a Plex step into Jellyfin steps, for example
- Visual feedback indicates valid and invalid drop zones

### Example 2: App Download (Pre-Invite)

**Category**: Before Invite Acceptance

```markdown
# Download the Plex App

To access our media library, you'll need the Plex app installed on your device.

**Choose your platform:**

[üì± iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/plex/id383457673){:target="_blank" .btn}
[ü§ñ Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.plexapp.android){:target="_blank" .btn}
[üíª Windows](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/){:target="_blank" .btn}
[üçé macOS](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/){:target="_blank" .btn}

Click a download button above to continue.
```

**Tip**: Enable "Require Interaction" to ensure users download the app before joining.

### Example 3: Welcome Message (Post-Invite)

**Category**: After Invite Acceptance

```markdown
# Welcome to Our Media Server! üéâ

Congratulations! Your account has been created successfully.

## What's Next?

1. **Open the Plex app** you downloaded earlier
2. **Sign in** with your Plex account

## Multi-Server Invitations

### How It Works

For invitations that cover multiple media servers, Wizarr automatically combines steps:

1. **Pre-invite steps** from all servers are shown in sequence
2. **User accepts invitation** and accounts are created
3. **Post-invite steps** from all servers are shown in sequence

### Server Indicators

The wizard clearly indicates which server each step belongs to, helping users understand the context.

***

## Wizard Bundles with Categories

### Mixed Category Bundles

Wizard bundles can now include steps from both categories:

1. **Create a bundle** in the wizard settings
2. **Add steps** from both pre-invite and post-invite categories
3. **Reorder as needed** - bundle order overrides category
4. **Assign to invitations**

### Bundle Behavior

When a bundle is assigned to an invitation:

- **Bundle steps are shown in bundle order** regardless of category
- **Category-based routing still applies** (pre-wizard ‚Üí join ‚Üí post-wizard)
- **Steps are filtered** based on the current phase

***

## Migration from Previous Versions

### Automatic Migration

When you upgrade to a version with pre/post-invite support:

1. **All existing wizard steps** are automatically assigned to "After Invite Acceptance" (post-invite)
2. **Existing invitation links** continue to work without changes
3. **Existing wizard bundles** function exactly as before
4. **No manual intervention** is required

### Gradual Adoption

You can adopt the new feature gradually:

1. **Start with post-invite steps** (existing behavior)
2. **Add pre-invite steps** as needed for specific server types
3. **Test the flow** with new invitations
4. **Refine and iterate** based on user feedback

### Backward Compatibility

- The old `/wizard` endpoint redirects to `/post-wizard` automatically
- Invitations without pre-invite steps skip directly to the join page
- All existing features (bundles, multi-server, interaction requirements) work with both categories

***

## Best Practices

### Pre-Invite Steps

- **Keep them brief** - Users haven't committed yet
- **Focus on essentials** - Terms, rules, prerequisites
- **Use interaction requirements** - Ensure users engage with important content
- **Avoid overwhelming** - Too many pre-invite steps may discourage users

### Post-Invite Steps

- **Welcome users warmly** - They've just joined!
- **Provide clear next steps** - How to access content
- **Include helpful resources** - Support links, Discord, request systems
- **End with encouragement** - Make users excited to use the service

### Step Organization

**Good Pre-Invite Flow:**
1. Welcome and introduction
2. Terms of service
3. App download instructions

**Good Post-Invite Flow:**
1. Welcome message
2. Getting started guide
3. Request system integration
4. Community links

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Pre-invite steps not showing | Check that steps are assigned to "Before Invite Acceptance" category |
| Users skip pre-invite steps | This shouldn't be possible - check server logs for errors |
| Steps in wrong order | Verify position values and drag-and-drop to reorder |
| Category not saving | Ensure you're using the latest version with migration applied |

### Debug Tips

1. **Check the wizard admin** - Verify steps are in the correct column
2. **Test with a new invitation** - Use a fresh invitation link
3. **Clear browser cache** - Old JavaScript may cause issues
4. **Check server logs** - Look for wizard-related errors
